# Lab 13: Create and configure an Azure web app

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 11 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 11 desktop. The taskbar contains the icon for the application that you'll use in this lab:

- Microsoft Edge

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will deploy and configure an Azure Web App that integrates with GitHub. The web app will be a simple implementation of a single-page web app accessible only to internal employees. The website will host content related to company strategies and division sales goals.

To create the web app, you will use the Azure portal and connect it to a GitHub repository. To do this, you will need a free GitHub account, where you will upload the sample website content provided as part of this lab. Once the web app is up and running, you will make changes to the content and watch as the GitHub content is synced to the web app, using the CI/CD methodology.

Because this is an employee-only web app, you will need to secure access to the web app by creating users in Azure AD and implementing security for the web app through user authentication.

| summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 1h), resultCode   
```

1. This query retrieves the number of requests and the HTTP status code for each hour over the last 24 hours. You can modify the time range and granularity of the query as needed.

1. Select **Run** to execute the query. The results will be displayed in a table below the query editor.

1. You can also visualize the query results by clicking on the **Chart** button in the query editor. This will open a chart that displays the data in a more visual format.

1. If you want to save the query for future use, select the **Save** button and give the query a name and description.
