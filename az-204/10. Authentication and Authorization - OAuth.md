OAuth is industry standard protocol when it comes to Authorization

Here are the OAuth Grant Types:
- Authorization Code
- PKCE
- Client Credentials
- Device Code
- Refresh Token

## Client Credentials
We already worked with "Client Credentials" when we requested the token string using Postman in previous section.

```html
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.com
 
grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
&client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx
```

## Authorization Code
The Authorization Code Grant Type is probably the most common of the OAuth 2.0 grant types that youâ€™ll encounter. It is used by both web apps and native apps to get an access token after a user authorizes an app.<br>
So when we login into a web app using credentials which could be validated against Entra ID server, the app typically uses Authorization Code grant flow.

Consider the following flow where a user request an image:<br>
User <===> Web App <=====================> Azure Storage Service Web API <====> Azure Storage Account (For Images)

In all this, consider the presence of Authorization Server which is Microsoft Identity Platform in Azure.<br>
It managers end user info, their access and also issues secure access tokens.<br>

Step 1: The app makes a contact with Authorization Server for an authorization code along with a callback (aka Redirect) URL. The Auth code is viewable in browser.

Step 2: The app send back the auth code to the Auth Server to get the access token

Step 3: The application gets the secure access token. The exchange process happens on the backend and you wont see the access token in browser because of security concerns.

Step 4: The app can now use the access token to make a request from Azure Storage Service Web API to get the image
