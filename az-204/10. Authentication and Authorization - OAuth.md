OAuth is industry standard protocol when it comes to Authorization

Here are the OAuth Grant Types:
- Authorization Code
- PKCE
- Client Credentials
- Device Code
- Refresh Token

## Client Credentials
We already worked with "Client Credentials" when we requested the token string using Postman in previous section.

```html
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.com
 
grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
&client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx
```

## Authorization Code
The Authorization Code Grant Type is probably the most common of the OAuth 2.0 grant types that youâ€™ll encounter. It is used by both web apps and native apps to get an access token after a user authorizes an app.<br>
So when we login into a web app using credentials which could be validated against Entra ID server, the app typically uses Authorization Code grant flow.
