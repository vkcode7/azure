## Azure AAD aka Entra ID

An app can interact with resource usig access keys. Another approach is to regiter an app id object in AAD, assign it access on the resource and then use that app identity in the app to access the object.<br>
To do this follow these steps:<br>
- Go to AD -> App Registrations -> New REgistration
- Give a name such as "MyXyzApp" and hit register
- Once registered you will get "Application / ClientId" and "Directory / tenant ID" in properties, we need these to connect from our app.
- Under "MyXyzApp" => Certificates and Secret you can create a new client secret (aka Password), this is also needed in app. It is a description / key pair such as "secret" / "Xwrt312321313gvaad".
- Next go to your resource and click on "Access Control"
- Click on "Add Role Assignment", select a Role such as "Reader" role, and assign "MyXyzApp" to the "Reader" role
- This will let the MyXyzApp read the properties of that particular stoarge account
- Next look for "Storage Blob Data Reader" role and assign "MyXyzApp" to the same
- Now come back to app code (c# app here)
- We dont need Access Keys/ Connection string anymore
- Instead we need "tenantId", "clientId", and "clientSecret"

  Here is how the code looks:
  ```c#
  using Azure.Identity;
  using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
  
  string tenantId = "70c0f6d9-7f3b-4425-a6b6-09b47643ec58";
  string clientId = "b4d0b1b0-21f6-4b57-a6cc-ca982114e340";
  string clientSecret = "1ym8Q~uaRr2d5LtGSB9K36JxhJzN-MB2iMxirbyr";
  
  string blobURI = "https://appstore500505.blob.core.windows.net/data/script.sql";
  string filePath = "C:\\tmp1\\script.sql";
  
  ClientSecretCredential clientCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(tenantId, clientId, clientSecret);
  
  BlobClient blobClient = new BlobClient(new Uri(blobURI),clientCredential);
  
  await blobClient.DownloadToAsync(filePath);
  
  Console.WriteLine("The blob is downloaded");
  ```
